## ReactJs located in client folder

## NodeJs file structure located in app folder


Express as frame work , sequelize as ORM , PassPort as authentication middleWare 

my server works properly on handleBars engine , and my local data base , authentication works good

i have used Axios module as react middleWare for Post method 

my problem is : 

1. i cant connect nodeJs and react  , i think my package.JSON scripts are wrong , i have installed a "concurrently" package which runs multi commands , it runs react and server at the same time , but im not sure if they're conncected 

2. im not sure if my axios method used right , please take look at './client/src/container/Signup/index.js'

# please take look and estimate the time , 
my dead line is in 2 days , i'm sure this wont take a long time for you 


after authentication we need to create another models ,
we need full intergate to costumer DB ,
and be sure every thing works good.

i will send U costumer task list to make sure we have considered everything.

thank you so much
